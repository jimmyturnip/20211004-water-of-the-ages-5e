# Psionics

The original Dark Sun rules gave every character a wild talent, a minor psionic power. I'm not going to set up a whole new psionics system, so I'll just say that everyone gets a cantrip from any spell list. The spellcasting ability depends on the class of the spell chosen: Charisma for bard, sorcerer or warlock; Wisdom for cleric or druid; or Intelligence for wizard.
