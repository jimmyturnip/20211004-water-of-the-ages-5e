# Session 1

Turlust leads the Nathram caravan out of Tyr, but even before it reaches the gates of the city, it's attacked by looters, either brave or desperate from the recent changes the city has undergone. After a hard-won battle atop the caravan's main wagon, they pass through the gates and into the baking desert. Himdri and Turlust discuss the quest that the warrior was charged with, and the dwarf gives him words of warning.

## Setup

It's a few days since King Kalak of Tyr was killed by a magical spear through his heart. Tithian, his chief templar, has taken control, riots have calmed down, and a sense of peace descends on the city-state, like the hours after a terrible sandstorm.

The merchant house of Nathram has already delayed its next caravan trek to Urik for too long, and preparations are underway to set off. Among the members of the caravan are Turlust, a guard for the merchant house, Himdri, a craftsman and buyer, and Laeral, a loyal retainer with a mysterious background.



## Scene 1
**Setup**: The caravan sets off from Tyr.  
**Interrupted**: [Malice, Masses] As the caravan sets off towards the Caravan Gate on the northern side of the city, it is attacked by a group of opportunistic looters.  
**What's fun about this scene**: Could get nasty.  

The mekillot pulling the huge wagon loaded with goods has begun its slow march through the city. All around lies the detritus of the last few days of looting. The Caravan Gate is in sight, when suddenly chaos breaks loose. A gang of looters breaks out from hiding places in the alleyways and rushes towards the main wagon.

    Do any of the heroes notice the attack before it happens?
    Perception checks vs DC 12.
    Turlust +3. 18. Success.
    Laeral +1. 6. Fail.
    Himdri +3. 10. Fail.

> TURLUST  
> Watch out! Watch the alleyways!

Turlust cries out as he notices dark figures peeking out from the shadows. He raises his crossbow and fires as several start running towards the wagon on which he's standing.

    Turlust makes a ranged attack roll. +4 vs AC ??. 8. Probably a miss.

The bolt goes wide, but at least he got a warning off. Hopefully, he's saved a few lives.

    Who's attacking them? There's a large group of attackers, but the other  
    members of the caravan can deal with those. The group attacking the upper  
    turret, where Turlust, Laeral and Himdri are, includes a half-giant  
    (treat as an ogre) and four human looters (bandits).

The looters are climbing up the side of the huge wagon, holding wicked-looking knives in their mouthes. Meanwhile, the half-giant bounds up the side at frightening speed. Turlust, Laeral and Himdri are all standing at the top of the wagon, on a walled platform with spear protruding to fend off attackers.

    The half-giant climbs over the side of the wagon. I'll have it make a
    DC 12 Dex saving throw to avoid the spikes on the side. -1. 8. Fails. It
    takes 7 (2d6) piercing damage. Now it attacks Turlust. +6 vs AC 18. 21. 
    Hits for 9 (2d8+4) damage.

**Turlust** fires another bolt as the half-giant comes lumbering up the side of the wagon. As the looters get nearer, **Laeral** reaches into a pouch and draws out a handful of sand. As she mumbles words of power, her eyes momentarily flash with elongated, reptilitan pupils, and three of the looters suddenly release their grip and fall back into the road. Other guards on the ground begin to deal with them. **Himdri** utters a prayer to the spirits of earth, invigorating himself and his allies, before joining his warrior companion in battle.

The **half-giant** roars in pain as he grazes himself on a spike, but manages to climb over the side of the wagon. Now he stands before Turlust. He swings his greatclub, and smashing into the warrior's chitin-plated pauldron, taking him off-guard.

    ROUND 2
    Turlust | HP 28, 19

    for 13 (2d8+4) damage.

**Turlust** makes a flurry of swings against the half-giant, and manages to land a couple of grievous blows. The **looter** strikes Himdri with a vicious-looking obsidian scimitar, and the cleric loses the blessing spell from his mind. **Laeral** shoots a bolt of fire into the looter, searing his chest. **Himdri** swings at the **half-giant**, but it's not enough to prevent the lumbering creature from landing a nasty blow on Turlust.

    The half-giant attacks Turlust. +6 vs AC 18. 20. Hits for 9 (2d8+4)
    bludgeoning damage.

The scrap on the wagon's platform continues. Himdri and Turlust land blows on the half-giant, which in turn hits back at Turlust. The warrior is looking in bad shape.

    ROUND 4
    Turlust | HP 28, 19, 6, 14, 5

    AC 11. 10. Miss.
    The half-giant attacks Turlust with his greatclub. +6 vs AC 18. 10. Miss.

Turlust lands another blow on the half-giant, but it's still not enough to down the hulking figure. Himdri utters words of healing suffused with the strength of earth spirits at Turlust. The half-giant tries to strike Turlust, but Himdri's words embolden him.

    ROUND 5
    Turlust | HP 28, 19, 6, 14, 5, 12  
    Looter 1 | HP 13, 9
    Laeral | HP 21

Finally, Laeral's magical fire hits home and engulfs the half-giant. As it wrestles, trying to dowse the flames, it teeters over the edge of the wagon. Himdri lands a grievous blow on the looter.

    ROUND 6

    Himdri | HP 27  
    Turlust attacks the looter. +5 vs AC 12. 16. Hits for 7 (1d8+5) slashing.
    He's dead!

Just as the battle atop the great wagon ends, so too the gang of looters melts back into the alleyways. Sweating and bloody, Turlust surveys the street. Bodies, both looters and caravan guard litter the road. They can't afford to linger here and obtain their dead, though. Leave them to the templars - who just happened to be nowhere in sight this whole time. No surprises there.





## Scene 2
**Setup**: The caravan sets off from Tyr.  
**Altered/Interrupted**: No.  
**What's fun about this scene**: Chance for social interaction, learn about the caravan.  

Templars at the towering Caravan Gate wave the Nathram caravan through without further delays. It's hard to believe they didn't see the attack on the caravan, and yet they did nothing to help. Turlust glares at them as they pass.

    Let's ask a few questions about the caravan.
    Is Turlust the leader (somewhat likely, 65%)? 53. Yes. He's been charged
    with leading this mission.
    What is the caravan's cargo? Roll on Random Element Descriptors from Mythic
    Magazine 3. [Valuable, large] Lumber, as well as craft goods.
    How badly was the caravan affected by the attack? Roll 1d100. 6. Not very,
    only a few guards were hurt.

Once past the gate, Himdri comes over to Turlust.

> HIMDRI  
> That was close. Lucky there weren't more of them. We could have come off much worse. Look at you. Barely out of Tyr and your half-dead. Come. Let me bind those wounds.

Turlust nods and follows Himdri under to the makeshift shade on top of the wagon. The canvas flutters loudly in the breeze.

> TURLUST  
> I'm glad to get out of that cursed city. Kalak dead. A templar on the throne. Who know which one's worse. At least where we go, we know who and what to look out for.

> HIMDRI  
> Don't be so sure. You of all people should know the dangers that these wastes hide. And what about that urn full of...whatever it is. The Water of the Ages. Isn't that what the elf called it? Bah! He's having you on.

> TURLUST  
> He's dead, remember? Araldor was a friend. We had many adventures together back when I was with the Talons. I owed him my life, and I'll pay that debt. He asked me to take this to Urik, and that's what I'll do.

> HIMDRI
> And I'll see to it that we all get there, friend. Just don't put too much faith in the words of a dead man. It's the living that matter. We honour the dead with our prayers and thoughts, not with fool's errands.

Turlust looks darkly into the sickly-coloured horizon as he considers his friend's words.

    Decide on wilderness travel procedure
