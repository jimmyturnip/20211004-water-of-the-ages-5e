## Setup

It's a few days since King Kalak of Tyr was killed by a magical spear through his heart. Tithian, his chief templar, has taken control, riots have calmed down, and a sense of peace descends on the city-state, like the hours after a terrible sandstorm.

The merchant house of Nathram has already delayed its next caravan trek to Urik for too long, and preparations are underway to set off. Among the members of the caravan are Turlust, a guard for the merchant house, Himdri, a craftsman and buyer, and Laeral, a loyal retainer with a mysterious background.



## Scene 1
**Setup**: The caravan sets off from Tyr.  
**Interrupted**: [Malice, Masses] As the caravan sets off towards the Caravan Gate on the northern side of the city, it is attacked by a group of opportunistic looters.  
**What's fun about this scene**: Could get nasty.  

The mekillot pulling the huge wagon loaded with goods has begun its slow march through the city. All around lies the detritus of the last few days of looting. The Caravan Gate is in sight, when suddenly chaos breaks loose. A gang of looters breaks out from hiding places in the alleyways and rushes towards the main wagon.

    Do any of the heroes notice the attack before it happens?
    Perception checks vs DC 12.
    Turlust +3. 18. Success.
    Laeral +1. 6. Fail.
    Himdri +3. 10. Fail.

> TURLUST  
> Watch out! Watch the alleyways!

Turlust cries out as he notices dark figures peeking out from the shadows. He raises his crossbow and fires as several start running towards the wagon on which he's standing.

    Turlust makes a ranged attack roll. +4 vs AC ??. 8. Probably a miss.

The bolt goes wide, but at least he got a warning off. Hopefully, he's saved a few lives.

    Who's attacking them? There's a large group of attackers, but the other  
    members of the caravan can deal with those. The group attacking the upper  
    turret, where Turlust, Laeral and Himdri are, includes a half-giant  
    (treat as an ogre) and four human looters (bandits).

    COMBAT

    Looter 4 | Init 3  
    Himdri | Init 2  
    Half-Giant | Init 2  

The looters are climbing up the side of the huge wagon, holding wicked-looking knives in their mouthes. Meanwhile, the half-giant bounds up the side at frightening speed. Turlust, Laeral and Himdri are all standing at the top of the wagon, on a walled platform with spear protruding to fend off attackers.

    Looters 2, 3 and 4 are asleep.
    Himdri casts bless on himself, Turlust and Laeral (+1d4 to attack rolls and
    saving throws), and moves to stand next to Turlust.
    The half-giant climbs over the side of the wagon. I'll have it make a
    DC 12 Dex saving throw to avoid the spikes on the side. -1. 8. Fails. It
    takes 7 (2d6) piercing damage. Now it attacks Turlust. +6 vs AC 18. 21. 
    Hits for 9 (2d8+4) damage.

**Turlust** fires another bolt as the half-giant comes lumbering up the side of the wagon. As the looters get nearer, **Laeral** reaches into a pouch and draws out a handful of sand. As she mumbles words of power, her eyes momentarily flash with elongated, reptilitan pupils, and three of the looters suddenly release their grip and fall back into the road. Other guards on the ground begin to deal with them. **Himdri** utters a prayer to the spirits of earth, invigorating himself and his allies, before joining his warrior companion in battle.

The **half-giant** roars in pain as he grazes himself on a spike, but manages to climb over the side of the wagon. Now he stands before Turlust. He swings his greatclub, and smashing into the warrior's chitin-plated pauldron, taking him off-guard.

    ROUND 2
    Turlust | HP 28, 19  
    Looter 1 | HP 13
    Laeral | HP 21  
    Himdri | HP 27

    vs AC 11. 9. Miss.

    spikes. Nat 20. Success. He attacks Himdri. +3 vs AC 18. 18. Hits for 4
    damage. Himdri makes a concentration check (Con). +2 vs DC 10. 5. Fail.
    The bless spell ends.
    Laeral casts fire bolt at the looter. +6 vs AC 12. 23. Hits for 4 (1d10)
    fire damage.
    Himdri attacks the half-giant with his warhammer. +5 vs AC 11. 12. Hits for

    The half-giant attacks Turlust with his greatclub. +6 vs AC 18. 20. Hits
    for 13 (2d8+4) damage.

**Turlust** makes a flurry of swings against the half-giant, and manages to land a couple of grievous blows. The **looter** strikes Himdri with a vicious-looking obsidian scimitar, and the cleric loses the blessing spell from his mind. **Laeral** shoots a bolt of fire into the looter, searing his chest. **Himdri** swings at the **half-giant**, but it's not enough to prevent the lumbering creature from landing a nasty blow on Turlust.

    ROUND 3

    attacks the half-giant with his battleaxe. +5 vs AC 11. 18. Hits for 6
    (1d8+5) slashing damage.

    Laeral casts fire bolt at the half-giant. +6 vs AC 11. 8. Miss.
    Himdri attacks the half-giant with his battleaxe. +5 vs AC 11. 21. Hits
    for 4 (1d8+3) damage.
    The half-giant attacks Turlust. +6 vs AC 18. 20. Hits for 9 (2d8+4)
    bludgeoning damage.

The scrap on the wagon's platform continues. Himdri and Turlust land blows on the half-giant, which in turn hits back at Turlust. The warrior is looking in bad shape.

    ROUND 4
    Turlust | HP 28, 19, 6, 14, 5  
    Looter 1 | HP 13, 9
    Laeral | HP 21

    AC 11. 10. Miss.
    The half-giant attacks Turlust with his greatclub. +6 vs AC 18. 10. Miss.

Turlust lands another blow on the half-giant, but it's still not enough to down the hulking figure. Himdri utters words of healing suffused with the strength of earth spirits at Turlust. The half-giant tries to strike Turlust, but Himdri's words embolden him.

    ROUND 5
    Turlust | HP 28, 19, 6, 14, 5, 12  
    Looter 1 | HP 13, 9
    Laeral | HP 21

Finally, Laeral's magical fire hits home and engulfs the half-giant. As it wrestles, trying to dowse the flames, it teeters over the edge of the wagon. Himdri lands a grievous blow on the looter.

    ROUND 6
    Turlust | HP 28, 19, 6, 14, 5, 12  
    Looter 1 | HP 13, 9, 2

    Himdri | HP 27  
    Turlust attacks the looter. +5 vs AC 12. 16. Hits for 7 (1d8+5) slashing.
    He's dead!

Just as the battle atop the great wagon ends, so too does the gang of looters melt back into the alleyways. Sweating and bloody, Turlust surveys the street. Bodies, both looters and caravan guard litter the road. They can't afford to linger here and obtain their dead, though. Leave them to the templars - who just happened to be nowhere in sight this whole time. No surprises there.
