# Prequel: Water of the Ages

[Use Adventure Crafter to come up with an adventure that the heroes have already shared, perhaps the incident that brought them together.]

During the riot in the city of Tyr that eventually ends the reign of Kalak, someone from Turlust's past appears and gives him a magic item of unknown use. Meanwhile, the merchant house that he and Himdri serve is preparing for a major caravan trek. Turlust consults Laeral and Himdri on the nature of the item.

	| What kind of item is it? [Smooth, Fuel]. Honey? Milk? Oil? Blood? Water? Blood's cool, but I'll
	| say water, as it's more fitting for the setting.
	| Who is the person? [Strong, Military]. Of course, it's one of Turlust's former comrades-in-arms.
	| What's their name? Araldor

Double Down: Whatever is happening in this Turning Point, those events will intensify. For instance, if a ship is leaking on the high seas during a storm, maybe torrential winds tear down the sails. [6, 71]

Preparation: This Turning Point involves a Character needing to prepare for something. For instance, a wizard must study up on how to banish demons before a villain arrives, or a town of prospectors and merchants must learn how to fight before the band of outlaws arrives to exact their revenge for hanging a comrade. [4, 74]

A Figure From The Past: A new Character joins the Adventure, someone from a Character’s past. This Plot Point requires a new Character to be added to the Characters List and Invoked. [9, 49]

An Object Of Unknown Use Is Found: A Character finds something that they think is useful, but they do not know in what way. This may be a magic wand that they don’t know how to use, a key that they don’t know the lock it goes to, a device with an unknown purpose but currently has no power, etc. [10, 75]

Dealing With A Calamity: This Turning Point involves a Character having to “fight” a calamity of some kind. For instance, maybe the Character is battling a fire to put it out, or he must fight his way through an ancient stone temple as it collapses around him. [7, 74]
