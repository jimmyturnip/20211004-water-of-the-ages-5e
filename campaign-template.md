# Campaign Template

## Concept

[Pitch this game. At a high-level, whatâ€™s it about? Remember that the game might last longer if:
	The setting has a clear, simple concept
	The rule system is elegant and cohesive
	Character generation includes narrative elements
	Scene generation systems yield fun results
]

Higher-level game set in the world of Dark Sun.
Possibly a hexcrawl (sand crawl?).
The heroes are retainers for a merchant house.

## Aim

[Explain what the players are trying to accomplish. Can someone win? Can everyone lose? Are we trying to tell a specific type of story? The game might last longer if:
	You have time to devote to it - short, swift bursts
	It's not just the next shiny, but something you really want to play long-term
	There's a clear vision for the game - don't rely too heavily on randomisers
	There's an achieveable endpoint, such as "7 sessions" or "when the group arrives at their destination"]

Initially, aim for 3-4 sessions.
Bounded aim: find a thing or person, or assassinate someone.

## Tone

[Have a quick conversation about the tone of the game. What is the default? Are there different options for gameplay? (Serious vs. Gonzo, Action vs. Drama, etc.). Come to a consensus on what the group wants.]

## Solo Gaming

[What novel factors will this campaign bring in? What procedures will you use for generating content, such as dungeons, or wilderness and city areas? How will you generate interesting scenes and avoid logjams? Ideas:
	Find or create maps
	Find character art
	Write flashbacks
	Add details about the setting
