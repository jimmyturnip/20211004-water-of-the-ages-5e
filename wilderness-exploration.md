# Wilderness Exploration

One scene is a day. Altered and interrupted scenes might model getting lost. Otherwise, each day, ask these questions:

	DAY X
	WEATHER
	  What's the weather like? Use D&D generator (see below), except there's
	  never any precipitation.
	DANGERS
	  Does the party avoid any dangers? Wisdom (Survival) vs DC 13 [adjust
	  according to threat level].
	  If yes, proceed.
	  If no, generate a creature using XGtE (desert encounters).
	  What time of day is it? 1d12 x 2.
	  What's it doing? Use Mythic.
	  What's the encounter distance? 4d6 x 10 ft.
	  Does it see the party? Yes, or Wisdom (Perception) if party is being
	  stealthy.
	  Does the party see it? Wisdom (Perception) vs passive Stealth.
	  What's the creature's disposition? Roll on Ironsworn disposition table.
	  Add a value (e.g. +20) if the creature is likely to be hostile.
	DISCOVERY
	  Does the group find a point of interest? Wisdom (Perception) vs DC 15.

## Dehydration

A character needs one gallon of water (2 waterskins) per day, or two gallons (4 waterskins) per day of the weather is hot. A character who drinks only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 Constituition saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion at the end of the day. A character with access to even less water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of the day.

If the charcter already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the character takes two levels in either case.

NOTE: A typical waterskin carries 4 pints, or  1/2 a gallon.
