## 14.05 Silver Spring

From the *Wanderer's Journal*, AD&D 2nd Edition Dark Sun boxed set: There is nothing silver about this oasis: the water is foul-tasting and brown, the bushes in the surrounding scrub plains are dun-colored and thorny, and the rocks are burnt orange, just like in the stony barrens of the rest of Athas. The reason the oasis is called the Silver Spring is because the elven chief who settled his tribe here demands a piece of silver (or something equivalent) of anyone who wishes to water at the pool. He and his warriors generally attack anyone who fails to pay.
