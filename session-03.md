## Setup

The heroes go to Abersath's camp to "deal with" the elf lieutenant.




## Scene 1

**Setup**: At night, the heroes follow the elves' directions to Abersath's camp.  
**What's fun about this scene**: Finding and possibly scouting the camp.  

Swallowing their pride, the heroes leave Silver Spring and head for Abersath's camp.

    Do they have a guide (65%)? 36. Yes.
    More than one (35%)? 65. No.
    Who are they? Name is Manatak.
    Are they an elf (85%)? 1. Exceptional yes.
    What are they like? (Mythic Magazine 2, Meaning Tables: Descriptions) [Messy, odd]
    Male (1-3), female (4-5) or NB (6)? 3. Male.

Their guide, an elf named Manatak, is an odd, dishevelled fellow, who doesn't seem to spend too much time around anyone, let alone strangers from outside his tribe. Under the light of the two moons, the small group makes their way across the dunes until eventually Manatak stops.

> MANATAK  
> Abersath's camp is on the other side of that ridge.

The group begins climbing up the side of the dune. They stay low when they get to the crest.

    Is the camp just tents, or some other kind of structure (50%)? 54. Some other kind of structure.
    Is it a tower or fort (65%)? 77. No, plus event.

They stay low as they reach the crest and take in the scene below. Jutting from the sands is the husk of a huge, long-dead creature. Cloths and skins cover the creature's upturned ribcage, which is at least twice the size of the caravan wagon. Between the rib-supports, the light of campfires is cast into the desert.

    How many people are in the camp? I'll say 2d20. 22.
    Are they elves or is it mixed (50%)? 39. All elves.
    What other details are there? [Return, competition].

As they look on, they see that much of the camp is gathered in a wide circle. Two figures seem to be fighting in the middle. Occasional shouts are carried on the wind.

    I forgot to add an event earlier. NPC positive (Abersath). Mistrust, trials.
    Hmmm... Will come back to this later.
