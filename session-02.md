# Session 2

*Summary:* The caravan sets off into the Alluvial Sand Wastes following the Urik road. During the nights, they talk about the ghosts of their past, and their dreams for the future. After a few days of arduous travel, they arrive at Silver Spring, an oasis ruled by an elf tribe. The elves offer a warm welcome, but this is merely a ruse, as the chieftain blackmails the adventurers into dealing with a traitorous lieutenant.

## Setup

The caravan heads into the desert (see [local map](https://github.com/jimmyturnip/water-of-the-ages/blob/master/tyr-urik-map-hex.png), one hex = 6 miles). By following the roads, the journey to Urik should take about a week.

I'll use this [wilderness exploration procedure](https://github.com/jimmyturnip/water-of-the-ages/blob/master/wilderness-exploration.md), which is a mish-mash of several different systems, and a custom [encounter table](https://github.com/jimmyturnip/water-of-the-ages/blob/master/desert-encounters-1.md) adapted from *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*.



## Scene 1

**Setup**: The caravan heads into the desert  
**What's fun about this scene**: Hexcrawls are fun...?  

    DAY 1
    Temperature: 30 degrees hotter than normal
    Wind: None.
    Does the group avoid dangers? Turlust's Wisdom (Survival) +3 vs DC 13. 16.
    Success.
    Does the group find a point of interest? Himdri's Wisdom (Perception) +3 vs
    DC 15. 7. Fail.
    Rather than keeping track of supplies at a granular level, I'll just say the
    caravan consumes one day's worth of supplies and has six left.
    The caravan travels 4 hexes, following the road to the south-east. It makes
    camp in hex 06.04.

    On days when nothing else happens, I'll use the True-Gold Forge from Codex
    Gold magazine to generate some interaction moments between PCs.

    True-Gold Forge: Turlust (3, 5)

**What had Turlust heard of Himdri before they met?**  
Before they met, the other guards had warned Turlust that Himdri was a difficult customer. He has a reputation among the house staff for being fussy, demanding high standards to the point of obsession. Has Turlust's opinion changed? No, not really.

    True-Gold Forge: Laeral (2, 3)

**A prophetic dream..?**  
Laeral has been beset by dark dreams lately. She dreams of cloaked figures and chanting, and a many-armed demon ready to sacrifice her. It's the same dream each time, and Laeral isn't sure whether to take it literally or attribute it to some other factor.

    True-Gold Forge: Himdri (3, 2)

**Share your earliest memory**  
Himdri remembers playing with a small clay figurine of a woman when he was a child, and the sound of a woman singing, perhaps his mother. It must have been in the village where he was born, Ledopolis, as it didn't feel like the streets of Tyr. The figurine represented something, not a toy, but something important to his family, though he can't remember what. It's been a long time, and such frivolous thoughts have no place in the mind of a serious artisan.






## Scene 2

**Setup**: The caravan continues.  
**What's fun about this scene**: More hexcrawling.  

    DAY 2
    Temperature: Normal
    Wind: Light.
    Does the group avoid dangers? Turlust's Wisdom (Survival) +3 vs DC 13. 21.
    Success.
    Does the group find a point of interest? Himdri's Wisdom (Perception) +3 vs
    DC 15. 5. Fail.
    Five days of supplies remaining.
    The caravan travels 4 hexes, following the road to the south-east. It makes
    camp in hex 10.04.

    True-Gold Forge: Turlust (5, 3)

**Turlust asks about Laeral's pet scorpion**  
Gathered around the fire at night, Laeral pets and coos at the arachnid. Turlust grimaces in disgust.

> TURLUST  
> Does that thing have to come with us?

> LAERAL  
> She's not a thing. She's a living creature.

> TURLUST  
> Why do you bring it everywhere? It's just a scorpion. They're just...gross.

> LAERAL  
> She's not gross. She's beautiful, aren't you, dear?

The scorpion just sits in the palm of her hand. Laeral looks into the fire.

> LAERAL  
> Do you want to hear a story? There was a woman long ago, a mage of great power. She tended a garden. You see, not all mages take the path of the defiler, the path sinister, they call it. She loved her garden, and grew flowers and fruit more beautiful than you can imagine. One day, her love stumbled into her grotto with a terrible wound. He warned her that people were following him, and to be ready for them. Then a group of slavers came and saw their quarry. There were too many of them for the mage to take on with her magic, not without giving in to the path of defilement. But she refused to be tempted, and so her lover was slain and she was taken by the slavers. They say there's a cave somewhere in the Ringing Mountains filled with plants and wildlife found nowhere else. It's her cave. She chose slavery and the death of her love over using defiling magic. Do you see? That's why I keep the scorpion. If I were to be tempted, even for a second, to stray from the preserver's path, the scorpion would die. That's how you know I'm not one of them.

Turlust shrugs. Preservers, defilers, mages... it makes no difference to him. As long as his belly and his purse are full, he doesn't care.

    True-Gold Forge: Laeral (3, 4)

**Laeral hums a lullaby**  
The scorpion doesn't sleep, but others do, including Turlust.

    True-Gold Forge: Himdri (3, 4)

**What is the hope of Himdri's people?**  

> HIMDRI  
> What kind of foolish question is that? Why, to keep their young safe. To prosper. To create great works. Hmm. To see an end to the accursed sorcerer-kings. Well, that wish is coming true, but who knows what will happen now those templars are filling the void left behind. To see balance once again in the world. To see the fire in the sky tempered by cooling waters, and the sands rest for ever more, no longer whipped by the wind. These are our hopes. What of yours?





## Scene 3

**Setup**: Day three of travel.  
**What's fun about this scene**: Maybe an encounter today?  

    DAY 3
    Temperature: Twenty degrees hotter than normal
    Wind: None.
    Does the group avoid dangers? Turlust's Wisdom (Survival) +3 vs DC 13. 16.
    Success.
    Does the group find a point of interest? Himdri's Wisdom (Perception) +3 vs
    DC 15. 13. Fail.
    Four days of supplies remaining.
    The caravan travels 4 hexes, following the road to the south-east. It makes
    camp in hex 14.05 Silver Spring.

As the merciless sun dips towards the horizon, the monotony of the sandy wastes is broken by the sight of a clump of trees.

> TURLUST  
> Silver Spring. We've made it this far. Let us speak to the elves who claim this place. They can be a fickle lot.

The wagon and its escort party comes to a halt outside the oasis, and Turlust, Himdri and Laeral enter on foot.

    Are the elves here (very likely, 85%)? 14. Yes.
    Are they hostile (very unlikely, 25%)? 60. No.
    What is their chieftain like? Roll twice on Adventure Crafter Character
    Descriptions table. 89, 90. Intimidating, powerful.

The trio enters the elves' camp.

    What's going on here? I'll make a scenario with the Adventure Crafter.

See [Oasis of Blood](https://github.com/jimmyturnip/water-of-the-ages/blob/master/adventure-crafter/ac2-oasis-of-blood.md) plot.

    So, there's a conflict between the chieftain and his former lieutenant.

Things seem peaceful enough as they enter. The spear-wielding guards fall in beside the newcomers and tell them they must see the chieftain. As they pass through the oasis, they see tents dotted sparsely around the muddy pool at the centre, and people - all elves - go about their daily lives. Some barely glance at the odd trio, while others - mostly children - stop and watch with curiosity.

They arrive at a large tent with open sides. They feel relief as the tent provides shade from the relentless sun, even this late in the afternoon. Sitting cross-legged on the floor is an elven man of advanced years. Even sitting down, they can see he is tall and lithe, and the face paint - charcoal around the eyes and intricate white on the rest of the face - make a striking image. Nearby are other elves, men and women, also with faces painted, but none as elaborate as the chief.

> NYARLIM  
> To pass through our spring, you must pay in silver.

Turlust has made this trip a number of times and was ready for this.

> TURLUST  
> Yes, we accept.

> NYARLIM  
> Good. And you will break bread with us tonight.

Curious. This hasn't happened before. Still, Turlust and the others accept the chieftain's offer.





## Scene 4

**Setup**: Turlust, Laeral and Himdri sit down with the elves to dinner.  
**What's fun about this scene**: Might be asked to help with wayward lieutenant.  

After liaising with the rest of the caravan, Turlust, Laeral and Himdri return to the elven village.

    Why have they been invited to eat with the elves. Is there a celebration (50%)? 92. Exceptional no.

It's been a long time since the elves had anything to celebrate.

    Why, then? [Imitate, illusions]. The chieftain's medicine man instructed him.

The elves are gathered in a clearing. Rudimentary tables have been set up. There is a large bonfire, and meats are being roasted. The group is directed to a table near the chieftain. They are invited to eat.

    Do they break any protocols? I'll have Turlust make a Charisma (Persuasion) check. +1 vs DC 12. 15. Success.

Turlust stops Himdri from tuck right in.

> TURLUST  
> The chieftain eats first. Just wait.

As the chieftain takes the first mouthful of food, the rest of the elves begin eating.

    How does the group find out about the traitorous lieutenant? [Inspect, extravagance].

At one point during the meal, an argument breaks out between Nyarlim and another elf.

> ELF  
> You see? This is why Abersath abandoned us. You lavish food and luxuries on your people, and on strangers...

He points to the group.

> ELF  
...meanwhile, we leave nothing for tomorrow, or the day after. You'd have us become fattened up like prey. Is this the leader we want?

A silence descends the camp. Two of the chieftain's guard move towards the speaker, but the chieftain stops them with a gesture.

> NYARLIM  
> You are half-correct, Melandriel. I do indeed fatten up our people. Not to sit idle, though. No. I fatten us up to fight. Abersath will come. Ikali has seen it in the flames. Tomorrow, when the moons rise, Abersath will attack.

    Is the elf who spoke up contrite (50%)? 1. Exceptional yes.

The elf sinks to his knees.

> ELF  
> Forgive me, my chief. I spoke out of turn and embarrassed you in front of our people. I accept any punishment you see fit to give.

The shrewd old chieftain looks on.

> NYARLIM  
> No, my friend. You speak out of concern for the tribe, for your people. We will not only prepare for this attack, but we will strike preemptively.

> ELF  
> Yes! I will be your blade and your vengeance. Let Abersath know the mistake he made by betraying his chieftain.

A few "ayes" bubble up from the villagers.

> NYARLIM  
> No, Melandriel. Not you. These people will attack Abersath.

The chieftain points at Turlust, Laeral and Himdri.

> TURLUST  
> I'm sorry, but we cannot help you. We have a caravan to escort. There can be no delays.

> NYARLIM  
> This delay you will suffer. You will not lose out. I will make sure your people have provisions for any delays to your journey. Your caravan will be quite safe.

> TURLUST  
> And yet again, I must say no. We aren't members of your tribe. It wouldn't be right for us to get involved. We have already paid your toll. You cannot ask more of us.

The chieftain's face warps into a snarl.

> NYARLIM  
> I ask whatever I choose! And I choose that you be my executioners. Go to Abersath's camp this night, and slay the traitor. If you do not, your caravan will burn.

Sudden realisation hits Turlust. The caravan is indeed vulnerable, and Nyarlim's people would most probably overwhelm it in a fight. Turlust considers a moment, but then nods.

> TURLUST  
> Very well. We'll deal with this Abersath.

The chieftain claps his hands, and the tension is broken as a bard begins playing a merry tune. The three adventurers give each other baleful looks.
