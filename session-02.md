## Setup

The caravan heads into the desert (see [local map](https://github.com/jimmyturnip/water-of-the-ages/blob/master/tyr-urik-map-hex.png), one hex = 6 miles). By following the roads, the journey to Urik should take about a week.

I'll use this [wilderness exploration procedure](https://github.com/jimmyturnip/water-of-the-ages/blob/master/wilderness-exploration.md), which is a mish-mash of several different systems, and a custom [encounter table](https://github.com/jimmyturnip/water-of-the-ages/blob/master/desert-encounters-1.md) adapted from *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*.



## Scene 1
**Setup**: The caravan heads into the desert  
**What's fun about this scene**: Hexcrawls are fun...?  

    DAY 1
    Temperature: 30 degrees hotter than normal
    Wind: None.
    Does the group avoid dangers? Turlust's Wisdom (Survival) +3 vs DC 13. 16.
    Success.
    Does the group find a point of interest? Himdri's Wisdom (Perception) +3 vs
    DC 15. 7. Fail.
    Rather than keeping track of supplies at a granular level, I'll just say the
    caravan consumes one day's worth of supplies and has six left.
    The caravan travels 4 hexes, following the road to the south-east. It makes
    camp in hex 06.04.

    On days when nothing else happens, I'll use the True-Gold Forge from Codex
    Gold magazine to generate some interaction moments between PCs.

    True-Gold Forge: Turlust (3, 5)

**What had Turlust heard of Himdri before they met?**  
Before they met, the other guards had warned Turlust that Himdri was a difficult customer. He has a reputation among the house staff for being fussy, demanding high standards to the point of obsession. Has Turlust's opinion changed? No, not really.

    True-Gold Forge: Laeral (2, 3)

**A prophetic dream..?**  
Laeral has been beset by dark dreams lately. She dreams of cloaked figures and chanting, and a many-armed demon ready to sacrifice her. It's the same dream each time, and Laeral isn't sure whether to take it literally or attribute it to some other factor.

    True-Gold Forge: Himdri (3, 2)

**Share your earliest memory**  
He remembers playing with a small clay figurine of a woman when he was a child, and the sound of a woman singing, perhaps his mother. It must have been in the village where he was born, Ledopolis, as it didn't feel like the streets of Tyr. The figurine represented something, not a toy, but something important to his family, though he can't remember what. It's been a long time, and such frivolous thoughts have no place in the mind of a serious artisan.






## Scene 2
**Setup**: The caravan continues.  
**What's fun about this scene**: More hexcrawling.  

    DAY 2
    Temperature: Normal
    Wind: Light.
    Does the group avoid dangers? Turlust's Wisdom (Survival) +3 vs DC 13. 21.
    Success.
    Does the group find a point of interest? Himdri's Wisdom (Perception) +3 vs
    DC 15. 5. Fail.
    Five days of supplies remaining.
    The caravan travels 4 hexes, following the road to the south-east. It makes
    camp in hex 10.04.

    True-Gold Forge: Turlust (5, 3)

**Turlust asks about Laeral's pet scorpion**  
Gathered around the fire at night, Laeral pets and coos at the arachnid. Turlust grimaces in disgust.

> TURLUST
> Does that thing have to come with us?

> LAERAL
> She's not a thing. She's a living creature.

> TURLUST
> Why do you bring it everywhere? It's just a scorpion. They're just...gross.

> LAERAL
> She's not gross. She's beautiful, aren't you, dear?

The scorpion just sits in the palm of her hand. Laeral looks into the fire.

> LAERAL
> Do you want to hear a story? There was a woman long ago, a mage of great power. She tended a garden. You see, not all mages take the path of the defiler, the path sinister, they call it. She loved her garden, and grew flowers and fruit more beautiful than you can imagine. One day, her love stumbled into her grotto with a terrible wound. He warned her that people were following him, and to be ready for them. Then a group of slavers came and saw their quarry. There were too many of them for the mage to take on with her magic, not without giving in to the path of defilement. But she refused to be tempted, and so her lover was slain and she was taken by the slavers. They say there's a cave somewhere in the Ringing Mountains filled with plants and wildlife found nowhere else. It's her cave. She chose slavery and the death of her love over using defiling magic. Do you see? That's why I keep the scorpion. If I were to be tempted, even for a second, to stray from the preserver's path, the scorpion would die. That's how you know I'm not one of them.

Turlust shrugs. Preservers, defilers, mages... it makes no difference to him. As long as his belly and his purse are full, he doesn't care.

    True-Gold Forge: Laeral (3, 4)

**Laeral hums a lullaby**  
The scorpion doesn't sleep, but others do, including Turlust.

    True-Gold Forge: Himdri (3, 4)

**What is the hope of Himdri's people?**  

> HIMDRI
> What kind of foolish question is that? Why, to keep their young safe. To prosper. To create great works. Hmm. To see an end to the accursed sorcerer-kings. Well, that wish is coming true, but who knows what will happen now those templars are filling the void left behind. To see balance once again in the world. To see the fire in the sky tempered by cooling waters, and the sands rest for ever more, no longer whipped by the wind. These are our hopes. What of yours?





## Scene 3
**Setup**: Day three of travel.  
**What's fun about this scene**: Maybe an encounter today?

    DC 15. 13. Fail.
    Four days of supplies remaining.
    The caravan travels 4 hexes, following the road to the south-east. It makes
    camp in hex 14.05 Silver Spring.
