Personality Traits: I believe that anything worth doing is worth doing right. I can't help it - I'm a perfectionist. Also, I like to talk at length about my profession.
Ideal: It is the duty of all civilised people to strengthen the bonds of community and the security of civilisation.
Bond: I created a great work for someone, then found them unworthy to receive it. I'm still looking for someone worthy.
Flaw: I'm horribly jealous of anyone who can outshine my handiwork. Everywhere I go, I'm surrounded by rivals.

Temple: Acolytes of several like-minded deities all received instruction together in your temple.
Keepsake: A runestone said to be blessed by your god.
Secret: Even though you can work divine magic, you have never felt the presence of a divine essence within yourself.
